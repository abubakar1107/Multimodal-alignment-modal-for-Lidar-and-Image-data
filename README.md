# Multimodal-alignment-modal-for-Lidar-and-Image-data
Aligns LiDAR point clouds and RGB images for autonomous systems using PointNet++, Vision Transformer, and a Q-Former-inspired module. Trained on the KITTI dataset, it generates unified embeddings with cosine similarity loss and includes a prototype detection head for 2D/3D object localization.
